### Problem 1

#### Read and clean the Mr.Â Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
Mr_TW = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", range = "A2:N408", sheet = 1) %>% 
janitor::clean_names() %>% 
filter(dumpster != "NA") %>% 
mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls))) %>% 
rename("weight" = weight_tons, "volume" = volume_cubic_yards)
```

#### Read and clean precipitation data for 2017 and 2018. For each, omit rows without precipitation data and add a variable year

``` r
#2017 data
precip_17 = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(total != "NA") %>% 
#adding variable
  mutate(year = 2017)

#2018 data
precip_18 = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(total != "NA") %>% 
#adding variable
mutate(year = 2018)
```

#### Combine precipitation datasets and convert month to a character variable (the variable month.name is built into R and should be useful).

``` r
precip_17_18 =
  left_join(precip_17, precip_18, by = 'month') %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

#### Write a paragraph about these data

  - Be sure to note the number of observations in both resulting
    datasets
  - Give examples of key variables
  - What was the total precipitation in 2018?
  - What was the median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017?

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# The number of observations in the precipitation dataset
nrow(precip_17_18)
```

    ## [1] 12

``` r
# The number of observations in the Mr Trashwheel dataset
nrow(Mr_TW)
```

    ## [1] 344

``` r
# The total precipitation in 2018 was
sum((pull(precip_18, total)))
```

    ## [1] 70.33

``` r
# The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 was
median(pull(Mr_TW, sports_balls)[which(Mr_TW$year == 2017)])
```

    ## [1] 8
